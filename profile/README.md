## Video Super Resolution for an Improved Viewing Experience in Areas With Limited Internet Bandwidth
### Introduction
Video Super Resolution (VSR) is a technique for generating high-resolution video from low-resolution video. It is one of the challenging problems of computer vision, which has applications in various domains, ranging from medical image processing, remote sensing, improved surveillance from UAVs, and high-definition televisions. VSR can be considered an extension of Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) because a video is a collection of frames with a temporal relationship. While SISR algorithms can be applied to videos to obtain super-resolved frames, they can sometimes result in unwanted artifacts and unwanted temporal incoherence between the frames. This compels VSR algorithms to incorporate the temporal relationship between the frames to improve outcomes.
